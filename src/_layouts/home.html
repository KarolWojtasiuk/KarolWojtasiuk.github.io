about: I am a novice programmer open to learning new technologies and programming techniques. Coding is my hobby and I like creating new apps or automating things, this is the reason why I want to turn it into a professional job. I already have 4 years of non-commercial C# programming experience. During this time, I have been writing various small open source projects to prepare for a career I want to start soon.
